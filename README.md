# semantic-comments
Semantic comments is a simple and descriptive way to indicate the state of the code or the mood of the author when coding it.
The comments are divided into 2 main categories, although in some cases one underlines the other.

**State of the code:**

```html

Magic code:

<!--ಥ﹏ಥ-->
Help needed:

<!--ミ(ノﾟДﾟ)ノ-->
No time to stop:

Monkey code:
